# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Overview

Welcome to my repository for the (Machine Learning Zoomcamp by DataTalksClub)[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master]. Here you can find my notes of the course and the assignments I completed. This course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning.

## Course Content

**1. Introduction to Machine Learning:** This section introduces the foundational concepts of machine learning, the distinction between ML and rule-based systems, and tools such as NumPy and Pandas.

**2. Machine Learning for Regression:** Here, the focus is on regression techniques, data preparation, and feature engineering.

**3. Machine Learning for Classification:** This module covers classification methods, data preparation, and the importance of features.

**4. Evaluation Metrics for Classification:** This section delves into understanding accuracy, confusion tables, ROC curves, and other evaluation metrics.

**5. Deploying Machine Learning Models:** Learn about various deployment techniques, including Flask and Docker.

**6. Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning:** This module covers decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

**7. Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** Dive deep into learning concepts, TensorFlow, Keras, and convolutional neural networks.

**8. Serverless Deep Learning:** Understand serverless concepts, AWS Lambda, and TensorFlow Lite.

**9. Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving:** This section covers Kubernetes, TensorFlow Serving, and deployment techniques.

**10. KServe:** An optional module that provides insights into KServe, its applications, and deployment techniques.
